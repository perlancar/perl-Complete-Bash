        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add error message if COMP_LINE is not set.

        - Add argument 'word_breaks' to allow breaking at other characters, like
          bash's COMP_WORDBREAKS.


0.01    2014-07-02 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release, extracted from Complete-Util. format_completion() is
          from Complete::Util's format_shell_completion() but can also accept
          array instead of hash. parse_cmdline() is from Complete::Util's
          parse_shell_cmdline() but with a different return value.
